<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>   INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS.
TOPIC: COMPUTERS TODAY 
      DEFINE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN COMPUTERS
DEFINE A COMPUTER
	A computer is an electronic device that accepts data input,processes it under special instrument (programs), to produce a meaningful output information.
                 OR
	A computer is an electronic machine operating under the control of instruments stored in it’s memory that accepts data, processes it and produce meaningful results according to specific rules.

*CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN COMPUTERS*
	Computers store data 
	Computers are accurate/accuracy
	Computers are fast/speed 
	Computers are Diligence(Endurance)
	Artificial intelligence
	Versatility
	Automatic

1.	SPEED
	Computers operate extremely high speed.
	There speed is measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPs)

2.	AUTOMATION(SPONTANEOUS)
	Computers are automatic because they don’t need supervision to do their tasks/work that is instructed

3.	ACCURATE/ACCURACY
	A computer cannot make any mistake like humans do. The errors made in computing are due to the users entering wrong data and also the computer gives wrong information and that’s why we say (GIGO) Garbage In Garbage Out.

4.	STORAGE
	A computer must be able to store a large amount of information for future references 
        For a computer to work properly it must have a space for keeping it’s data. The space in the computer also helps it store information for future reference.

5.	DILIGENCE (ENDURANCE)
	A good computer must be able to perform the same task over and over again without getting tired and bored.

6.	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
	A computer is artificially intelligent i.e. It  can be programmed to do a certain task e.g. a washing machine which washes clothes after programming it, a microwave etc

7.	VERSATILITY/VERSATILE
	A good computer is able to do many activities. i.e Computers are capable of solving a wide range of problems at the same time.

  TERMINOLOGIES AND BASIC CONCEPTS
1.	INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT)
	It is a branch of engineering that deals with the use of computers and telecommunications to retrieve,store, and transmit information.
OR
	ICT is a combination of telephone lines, computers and softwares which enable the computer uses to create access, store, manipulate,store and transmit information.

2.	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)
	Information technology is the use of Computers in business, education and everyday life.

3.	DATA ENTRY
	Data Entry refers to an act of inputting data into the computer. This is done with the help of input devices like, mouse, keyboards, scanners etc

4.	BYTE
	A byte is a unit of a computer memory or digital information that consists of eight binary digits(8bits)
                     NB:
                          1 byte stores 1 character.
5.	BINARY
	The number system used to represent digital information in computer where data is expressed by combination of the digits 0 and 1 corresponding to power states “Off” and “On”respectively.

Example
1.	How many bits are in the word GIRL?
                                                   Soln
                                1 byte = 8bits
                                1 byte = 1 character
                                            = (4x8)bits
                                            = 32bits
Trials
1.	How many bits are in the following words.
(i)	SCHOOL
(ii)	STUDENTS
(iii)	BIT
(iv)	DEVELOPER
NOTE:   ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE WRITTEN ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND THE PICTURE SHOULD BE TAKEN USING YOUR PHONE CAMERA SENT IN THE WHATSAPP GROUP.
Field Of Study | WhatsApp Group
6.	COMPUTER MEMORY
	This acts as a store for digital data, processed and programs in a computer system.

    7.  DATA
	Data refers the raw facts and figures, that are entered into the computer by the user in the form suitable for processing.

Examples of data include;
(i)	Symbols
(ii)	Characters (A,B,C,D) etc
(iii)	Numbers etc.

8.	INFORMATION
	Refers to the processed data which is meaningful and is useful.

Examples of information.
(i)	A word e.g(Apple, Girl)
(ii)	A report
(iii)	An essay
(iv)	A letter
(v)	Mathematical formular etc

              CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD INFORMATION
i.	It should be accurate
ii.	It should be obtained from a reliable source
iii.	It should be communicated to a right person in time
iv.	It should be understandable to a user
v.	It should be relevant to it’s purpose

9.	RAM(RANDOM ACCCESS MEMORY)
	It is a temporary and volatile working memory that contains all the work in progress, since the user. Last saved to the disk.
	RAM changes constantly as the computer is used for different tasks and is lost when the computer is switched off.
       REASONS FOR STUDYING COMPUTERS
	We study computer to acquire general knowledge and skills in the use of Computers and related technologies.
	To use acquired knowledge in computer studies to enhance learning other subjects.
	To understand important issues of a technology based society and exhibit them using Computers.
	To get jobs e.g. teaching computer studies, lab technicians, software engineers etc.
	To acquire knowledge as a foundation for further studies in computer technology.
	To use variety of computer technology to access, analyse and interprete information.
